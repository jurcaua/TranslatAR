# TranslatAR
TranslatAR is an android app that combines Google Vision with translation software in order to help anglophones learn new languages.

The process is simple: point your phone camera at an object, pick of language of translation and prepare to be amazed.
TranslatAR films the object with your phone, shows the translation in desired language, 
provides an audio clip in order to facilitate the learning of the new language.

Our team created this app at MHacks9 on the weekend of March 24th-26th 2017. This was a unique experience for all of us because it was our
first time using the game engine Unity, which can be an extremely powerful tool in the right hands.
