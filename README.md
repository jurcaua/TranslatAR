# TranslatAR
TranslatAR is an app built in Unity that combines Google Cloud's vision API with IBM's Watson translation & text-to-speech API in order to help anglophones learn new languages and navigate unfamiliar countries.

**The process is *simple*:** point your phone camera at an object, pick the language of translation and prepare to be amazed.

TranslatAR films an object with your phone, shows the translation into the desired language, also providing an audio clip in order to facilitate the learning of the new language.

Our team created this app at MHacks9 on the weekend of March 24th-26th 2017. 
This was a unique experience for all of us because it was our first time using the game engine Unity, which can be an extremely powerful tool in the right hands.
